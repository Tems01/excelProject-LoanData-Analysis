# excelProject-LoanData-Analysis
To effectively monitor and evaluate the bank's lending activities and performance, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report is designed to offer valuable insights into critical loan-related metrics and their evolving trends. Its primary objective is to enable data-driven decision-making, facilitate ongoing assessment of the loan portfolio's health, and pinpoint trends that can serve as valuable inputs for refining the lending strategies. The data "finacialLoan.csv" is imported into excel for analysis. See "BankLoanData" for analysis and Dashboards
